(Theme - "Lights Out!")
==============

* Code for the 05 Bacon Game Jam (06-09-13)
* Written in Python v2.7 with Pygame v1.9.1
* http://stephenmeier.net/files/lightsout.zip

To play use the arrow keys or W,A,S,D. The object of the game is to collect all the flames while avoiding all hostile flames (flames switch between hostile and non-hostile). Your life is connected to the strength of your candle light. If the candle goes out it is "Lights Out!" and game over.
